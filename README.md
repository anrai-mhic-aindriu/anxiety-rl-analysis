# anxiety-rl-analysis

## Short Summary
This project explores the effects of anxiety on learning and decision-making in a reinforcement learning task. Using data from a probabilistic reversal learning task, the project aims to model behavioural impairments in participants with anxiety and investigate differences in learning compared to participants without anxiety.

## Longer Summary

This project investigates whether participants with anxiety differ in how they learn to predict negative events, in the context of a reinforcement learning task. The task is a probabilistic reversal learning task inspired by an experiment conducted by Andrea D'Olimpio as part of his Masters by Research in the Series' Lab. Participants were recruited from the general population as those who self-identified as either anxious or calm, and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire to assess their anxiety levels. During the task, participants had to choose between two stimuli, with one stimulus leading to a loud unpleasant noise (i.e., an aversive outcome) and the other leading to a neutral outcome (i.e., no sound). The project aims to model the behavioural impairments observed in participants during this task and understand how anxiety may affect learning and decision-making. The code includes functions for data loading, data analysis, and simulations of the task with different parameter settings.
