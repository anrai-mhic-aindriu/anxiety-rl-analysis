# anxity-rl-analysis
This project explores the effects of anxiety on learning and decision-making in a reinforcement learning task. Using data from a probabilistic reversal learning task, the project aims to model behavioural impairments in participants with anxiety and investigate differences in learning compared to participants without anxiety.
